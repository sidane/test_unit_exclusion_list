= Test Unit Exclusion List

Ignore specific tests that are in an exclusion list.

This is to enable skipping of tests in plugins/engines that don't apply due to app specific requirements.

== Usage

In your test helper

  require 'test_unit_exclusion_list'
  
In sub-class of ActiveSupport::TestCase, or when over-riding ActiveSupport::TestCase

  acts_as_test_exclusion_list
